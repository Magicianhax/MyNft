# MyNFT Smart Contract

![NFT](link_to_nft_image.png)

This is a basic Non-Fungible Token (NFT) smart contract written in Solidity. It allows you to create and manage your own NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. You can customize the base URI for metadata and mint tokens as an owner. This contract is intended as a starting point for educational purposes and can be further enhanced for real-world use cases.

## Features

- Create and manage your own NFTs.
- Customize the base URI for metadata.
- Mint tokens as an owner.

Before deploying this contract, make sure you have the following:

- A compatible Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- An Ethereum development environment, such as Truffle or Hardhat, for local testing.
- The necessary dependencies, including Solidity and OpenZeppelin libraries.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Customize the contract as needed.
3. Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler.
4. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum testnet or mainnet.

## Usage
